# EduElevate
Academic Progress System:

“EduElevate”, Our proposed solution as a Mobile Application that helps students to track their grades, attendance, internal assessment (IA) marks and CGPA trends through clear and precise visuals of their academic history, providing personalized guidance on how much they need to score in future semesters to achieve their desired CGPA based on AI.

• AcadHub: The platform offers academic insights, helping students understand overall academic trends. Additionally, it serves as a centralized hub for college-related updates, including exam schedules, grading policies and faculty announcements.

• PlaceHub: A dedicated section in the app provides immediate updates on placements, sharing complete details about placement records and opportunities to keep students informed and updated.

• Connect-Through: Strengthens the relationship between juniors, seniors and alumuni by fostering mentorship and collaboration. It helps juniors adapt to the college environment, seek guidance from seniors and build a supportive academic network.

• Anonymous Teacher-Student Feedback System: An anonymous communication feedback system between teachers and students, where students can submit feedback, report difficulties about classes. Teachers receive this feedback without knowing the identity of the student, ensuring confidentiality and allowing students to share their thoughts freely.
